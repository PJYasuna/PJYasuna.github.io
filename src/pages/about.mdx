I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from The Chinese University of Hong Kong. I am currently a Master's student at UC San Diego major in Computer Engineering.

You can call me Joe, Jiayang, or Jiayang Pang (åºžå˜‰æ‰¬) ðŸ˜¬.

I'm interested in graph algorithms, especially dense subgraph mining. My paper, *A Similarity-based Approach for Efficient Large Quasi-clique Detection*, was published in [WWW 2024][www].

I'm passionate about software development. I contributed to the development of [TritonCalendar][calendarApp] and created a YouTube-like website called [TritonTube][tritontube]. I'm now working on BusTub, a relational database management system.

Outside of academia, I'm interested in animation. Iâ€™m currently playing Epic 7 ðŸŽ®, a real-time PvP mobile game, and Iâ€™m planning to develop some RTA BP helper tools for this game ðŸ™Œ.

Looking ahead, I am always seeking opportunities to build reliable and efficient software that excites me and inspires people.
